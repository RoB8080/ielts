As the internet developes, there are more and more news website nowadays, and lots of internet user read news on them. In this case, some people think the internet will somewhen replace the traditional way of delivering news - newspapers. Others believe that newspapers will remain the most important source of news. In my opinion, newspaper will be superseded with no doubt.

I believe the reason why newspaper kept its role before news website occurs is that it do have some advantages which others carrier of news don't have. 

The first main advantage is that, compares to TV News, where the news and their order to be delivered were fixed and a person's only choice is to follow them, you can actually decide which kind of news you want to read, and go for it directly.

Secondly, newspaper can also provide image to the reader rather than only text or audio (from radio) messages.

While, reading news on the internet also has these advantages. What's more, reading news online is also much more convenient than reading newspaper. I believe that the only place where people may read newspapers in the future is somewhere you can not get the access to the internet.

In a conlusion, newspapers will probably vanish completely, at least in most cases, in future.
