Nowadays, as the internet develops rapidly, there is research showing that a growing number of business training and business meetings taking place online. In my opinion, the advantages of online training and online meeting overweigh the disadvantages.

Firstly, It can considerably increase the efficiency of the company and reduce the cost. as we all know, there are more and more international company. Enterprises is no longer limited to one specific country. In fact, many mutli-national companies even have their office in almost all main countries. It's quite common that people who take charge of the company need to have a meeting together. It is definitely costly and time-consuming to have a offline meeting. While, with the internet, participants can have a meeting, sitting in their own office. And It is also applied for the online training.

Online business training and business meeting do promote the enterprise operation a lot. But just as a coin has two sides, online meeting and training have some defects, such as the security issue. Internet can be unsafe if a company doesn't prepare well. There have been many news that a company's server was hacked and their data was leaked.

In a conclusion, I definitly support to move meeting and training online. It can benefit the enterprise a lot and do worth the money used to fix the weakness.
