Nowadays, as the internet developing rapidly, there is research showing that more and more business training and business meeting taking place online. In my opinion, the advantages of online training and online meeting overweigh the disadvantages.

It has several advantages having meeting and training online. Firstly, as we all know, there are more and more international company. Enterprises is no longer limited to one specific country. In fact, many international companies even have their office in almost all main countries. It's quite common that the top management need to have a meeting together. It is definitely high-cost and time-wasting to have a offline meeting. While, with the internet, participants of a meeting can have a meeting, sitting in their own office. It can considerably increase the efficiency of the company and reduce the cost. And the same for the online training.

Internet does promote the enterprise operation a lot. But just as a coin has two sides, online meeting and training have some defects, such as the security issue. Internet can be unsafe if a company doesn't prepare well. There have been many news that a company's server was hacked and their data leaked. In the security area, the enterprise need to pay a lot to protect their data, but i believe the money they save is more than what they spend.

In a conclusion, I definitly support to move meeting and training online. It can benefit the enterprise a lot and do worth the money used to fix the weakness.
