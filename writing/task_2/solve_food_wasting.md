In some countries, wasting food is very common problem. People bought lots of food in shops and restaurants but they cannot finish them and the leftovers are thrown into garbage cans.

I think there are two main reasons for the phenomenon. Firstly, I think that the foods in shops and restaurants are meant to attract you to buy as much as you can. For example, image that you are in a Tesco, buying foods, you can be easily attracted by so many good-looking foods. They all look delicious and you just want buy all of them. If you cannot resist that idea, it's expected that you will buy more foods than what you can actually eat up on time, and finally some of them will just be thrown into a rubbish bin. When someone is a restaurant. The menu will do exactly the same thing and lead to the same result.

Secondly, I think another reason is that people's misestimating the amount of foods they want and can eat. Sometimes people just don't know how much food they actually need, especially when they are buying foods together. A person may know how much he or she want, but it's very hard for several people to estimate how much they want. 

To solve this problem, there is actually something we can do. The first thing we can do is to make a list about what we want to buy. It can help a lot when a person is in a restaurant or a shop, remind he or she to resist the lure of food and bought appropriate amount of food. You can also think that if the food you picked from the menu is too much or too less before you call the waiter. In a conclusion, to save foods, you need to keep aware of the amout of the foods in you daily life. That's the only thing which can really help preventing the waste of foods.
