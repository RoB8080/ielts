Research into new types of medicine and treatments are essential for improving health and dealing with disease. Who do you think should fund these researches: private companies, individuals or governments?

## Article
Nowdays, as the medical science developing, more and more medicine and treatments are invented. But it's not enough. There are still lots of people who suffer from the illness which have no method to cure or relieve. Researches of new types of medicine and tretments need investments, and the problem is who should fund these researches. In my opinion, private companies and governments should fund these researches.

Firstly, for the common dieases. Such as different kinds of cancer, they are the no.1 killer nowadays. For the private companies, if they can manage to develope a new medicine or treatment, they can definitly earn plenty of money which make their investment worthy.

Secondly, except those common dieases, there are also rare diseases which not many people know and not many people suffer from. The possibility is very low for private companies to invest in it. Because of the rarity, the expected return of funding these diseases is extremely low. So normally, private companies is unlikely to fun the researches of new medicine and treatment for rare disease. That's why governments should do their job and fund these researches so that the patients can get medicines and treatments in a reasonable price.

As for the individuals, generally they don't have enough money to fund these high-cost researches.

That's why i think both private companies and governments should fund the researches.
