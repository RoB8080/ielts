## Reqiurement
Nowadays, some people claim that public museums and art galleries will not be needed because people can see historical objects and works of art by using a computer. To what extent you agree or disagree with the opinion?

## Article
As the internet develops rapidly nowadays, we can get the text materials, audio materials and visual materials of almost everything you want. Lots of historical objects and works of art are also recorded on the internet as digital forms. For example, if someone want the to see the masterpieces of Van Gogh, he just need to type the name of the art work and google it. In just several milliseconds, what he want will be shown on the screen. It seems there is no need to go to the public museums and art galleries. But I don't think so.

Firstly, the digital record of something will definitly lose some details compared to the original work. As we all know, not like printing, painting takes the artist plenty of time. Sometimes an artist even spends years, layer by layer, finishing a single painting. So the painting itself contains lots of information about the painter, the technique and also the science and technogoly of that time. On the internet, you can never get such information from just a digital record.

And secondly, some historical objects and works of art are too fragile to be transfered into digital form. They need to be protected well, and cannot stand the flash of a camera or one single time scanning. You can see it clearly only if you get to the museum.

Meanwhile, the internet do has its advantages. For example, it's convenience and low-cost. One can see the objects and works without flying half the globe.

In a conslusion, the internet do provide a convenient way for the public to access the objects and works, but the museums and galleries are quite essential and irreplaceable.
