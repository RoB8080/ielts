## Article
The table compares the proportion of water usage in three sectors in six different countries in 2003.

As illustrated above, there are significant differents between those countries in water consumption, and we can classify them in to three types.

Firstly, Canada, Russia and UK use most of their water resource in industry, <font color=#FF4081>accounting for</font> 81%, 62% and 73%. As for residential and agricultural water <font color=#FF4081>distribution</font>, Russia use most water in agriculture (19%) and the same proportion of water for households. <font color=#FF4081>By contrast</font>, the UK use 23% of water in domestic sector, <font color=#FF4081>doubled that of Canada</font>, while it used only 4% water resources in agriculture, which was only half that of Canada.

<font color=#FF4081>The case was totally different in</font> China and Turkey <font color=#FF4081>where</font> agriculture was the main water consumer, reaching 87% and 73% <font color=#FF4081>separately</font>, thus totally less 30% of water was used for the other sectors.

It is in Australia that family usage <font color=#FF4081>occupied a massive 65% of water (占用了65%)</font> while <font color=#FF4081>one third was distributed for (三分之一被分配到)</font> agriculture.

In a conclusion, among these countries, industry and agriculture consumed most water while a reversed trend was almost true in families.
